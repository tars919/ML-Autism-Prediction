# ML-Autism-Prediction

What is the project:

Autism is a neurological disorder that affects people's ability to interact with others, impacting individuals behaviorally and socially.
There's no definitive way to diagnose autism since there are no specific diagnostic tests available. Here, we employ machine
learning to predict whether a person is diagnosed with autism or not.
