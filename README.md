# ML-Autism-Prediction

What is the project:

Autism is a neurological disorder that affects people's ability to interact with others, impacting individuals behaviorally and socially.
There's no definitive way to diagnose autism since there are no specific diagnostic tests available. Here, we employ machine
learning to predict whether a person is diagnosed with autism or not.


Needed imports:
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- Sklearn
- XGBoost
- Imblearn

#INFO
- Go to kaggle import the dataset and save it as train.csv
- To find the dataset search A1_score and it should come up -> autism spectrum prediction challenge
- Many print statments that are used to draw conclusions are commented out and organized in sections
- Add print statements to test parts of the code when needed
- can input another csv file for analyzing data
